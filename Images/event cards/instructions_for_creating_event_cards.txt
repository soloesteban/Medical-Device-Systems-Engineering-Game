Create SVG image code for all the event cards defined in the event_cards.qmd file. Follow these steps:

1. Put the content of the cards into a rounded rectangle of 85mm (height) by 60mm (width).
2. Create an individual text file for each SVG code for each card.
3. Use the event card template.txt file as the base template for the cards.
4. Ensure the text of the card fits into each card, wrapping text as necessary.
5. The card title text should be 3 words or less per line.
6. The rest of the content should be 4 words or less per line.
7. Lower the text of the effect closer to the bottom of the card.
8. Save the files in the folder called "event cards" that exists in the workspace.
9. The file names of each card should include the card ID (e.g., EV001_FDA_Fast_Track_Designation.txt).

These instructions can be reused whenever new event cards need to be created.
