# Game Setup

## Components
Before starting, ensure you have the following components:

- **Game Board**: A modular board depicting the six phases of development.
- **Player Tokens**: Representing each systems engineer.
- **Task Cards**: Challenges and tasks tied to each game phase.
- **Event Cards**: Unpredictable industry events that influence gameplay.
- **Dice**: Used for movement, task resolution, and random events.
- **Resource Tokens**: Representing funding, innovation, morale, and time.
- **Player Dashboards**: Used to track progress, resources, and morale.
- **Game Spinner**: Introducing probability-based scenarios.
- **Sand Timer**: Adding real-time pressure for decision-making challenges.

## Player Setup
1. **Choose a Player Token**: Each player selects a color/figure representing their systems engineer.
2. **Distribute Starting Resources**:
   - Each player begins with:
     - 5 Funding Tokens
     - 3 Innovation Tokens
     - 5 Morale Points
     - 2 Time Tokens
3. **Shuffle Cards**:
   - Shuffle Task Cards and place them face down in their designated areas.
     - Task Cards are color-coded and must match the game board task space color during gameplay.
   - Shuffle Event Cards into a separate deck.
4. **Place Player Tokens on the Board**:
   - All players start in the **Stakeholder Needs** phase.
5. **Determine Turn Order**:
   - Players roll a die; highest roll goes first. In case of a tie, the player with the highest engineering certification (ESEP > CSEP > ASEP > Non-certified) goes first.

## Starting the Game
- The first player rolls the dice to begin movement.
- Players follow the board path, drawing **Task Cards** as they enter new phases.
- The first player to complete all six phases and gain regulatory approval wins!
