# Design Notes

This section outlines the key design principles behind **Critical Path: The Systems Engineer’s Quest**, integrating best practices from *Your Turn!: The Guide to Great Tabletop Game Design* by Scott Rogers.

## Core Design Philosophy
The game is built upon three fundamental design principles:

1. **Engagement Through Realism** – The game accurately reflects the challenges of medical device development.
2. **Decision-Driven Gameplay** – Players must make strategic choices at every stage.
3. **Dynamic Interaction** – The combination of competitive and cooperative elements fosters an engaging experience.

## Applying *Your Turn!* Principles
### Player Agency & Meaningful Decisions
- Players are not just rolling dice but making crucial trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. quality in prototyping).
- Choices affect future outcomes—bad risk management early on can lead to major setbacks later.

### Risk vs. Reward Mechanics
- High-risk strategies (e.g., pushing a product to market early) can yield fast wins but also potential failures.
- Players must balance resources wisely, mirroring real-world engineering constraints.

### Thematic Integration
- The game board is structured as a development timeline, reinforcing the process-based nature of medical device engineering.
- Task Cards and Event Cards are modeled after real-world scenarios, ensuring authenticity.

### Player Interaction & Competition
- Players can trade, form temporary alliances, or sabotage competitors (e.g., patent disputes, regulatory hurdles).
- Limited resources encourage strategic conflict—who secures funding first?

### Accessible but Deep Mechanics
- Simple dice rolls determine movement and task outcomes.
- Advanced players can develop strategic depth through resource planning and negotiation.

## Playtesting Insights & Iterations
- **First Iteration:** Too much complexity—simplified task resolution mechanics.
- **Second Iteration:** Players enjoyed competition, so we added more interaction points (e.g., blocking regulatory approval).
- **Third Iteration:** Adjusted balance for resource tokens to prevent runaway leaders.

## Next Steps
- Finalize graphic design and board layout.
- Expand playtesting to refine balance.
- Develop digital companion tools (e.g., online score tracker, virtual task cards).
