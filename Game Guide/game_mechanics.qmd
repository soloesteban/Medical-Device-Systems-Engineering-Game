# Game Mechanics

## Movement
- Players roll a six-sided die (D6) to determine how many spaces they move.
- Certain spaces allow players to choose an alternate route, offering strategic flexibility.
- Some spaces require players to draw an **Event Card**, affecting their progress.

## Task Resolution
Each **Task Card** requires players to roll a die and apply relevant modifiers.

- **Success**: Progress in the development phase, gain morale, or receive resource bonuses.
- **Failure**: Face setbacks such as delays, resource loss, or morale reduction.
- Some tasks require a **critical success** (rolling a natural 6) to unlock bonus rewards.

## Resource Management
Players must manage key resources to stay on track:

1. **Funding Tokens** – Needed for research, development, and regulatory submissions.
2. **Innovation Tokens** – Improve success chances on technical and regulatory challenges.
3. **Morale Points** – Low morale affects dice rolls and efficiency. Losing all morale results in setbacks.
4. **Time Tokens** – Used to reduce delays or extend deadlines in project development.

## Conflict Resolution
Since multiple players are competing, conflicts arise when:

- Players attempt to patent similar technologies.
- Regulatory bodies impose restrictions that delay competitors.
- Market competition leads to funding cuts or loss of key team members.
- Players can negotiate, trade resources, or form temporary alliances.

## Special Mechanics
1. **Regulatory Challenges** – Certain event cards may introduce new regulations, forcing players to revise their design or reapply for approval.
2. **Chance & Risk Management** – Players can opt to take high-risk/high-reward decisions that can propel them forward or cause costly failures.
3. **Market Disruptions** – A game spinner determines random industry-wide events that may impact all players simultaneously.
