# Task Cards

Task Cards represent the challenges players must overcome in each phase of medical device development. These tasks require skill checks, resource management, and sometimes dice rolls to progress.

## How Task Cards Work

-   When landing on a **Task Space**, the player draws a Task Card.
-   Each Task Card specifies a challenge, required skill checks, and possible outcomes.
-   Players roll a die and apply skill/resource modifiers to determine the result.
-   Some tasks allow players to **spend resources to modify the outcome** if they are unsatisfied with the roll.

task card creation GPT

Create SVG image code for all the event cards defined in the task_cards.qmd file. Follow these steps:

1. Put the content of the cards into a rounded rectangle of 85mm (height) by 60mm (width).
2. Create an individual text file for each SVG code for each card.
3. Ensure the text lines of the card fits into each card, wrapping text as necessary.
4. The text should be 5 words or less per line.
5. Save the files in the folder called "task cards" that exists in the workspace.
6. The file names of each card should include the card ID.
