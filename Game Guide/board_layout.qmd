# Board Layout

The **Critical Path** game board visually represents the journey of bringing a medical device to market. It consists of six primary phases, each containing various task spaces and event spaces. Players progress through these phases in sequence, overcoming challenges along the way.

## Board Structure

The game board is divided into:
1. **Stakeholder Needs Phase (Green Section)**
   - Focuses on gathering user requirements and stakeholder alignment.
   - Includes spaces for patient interviews, physician consultations, and regulatory meetings.
   
2. **System Architecture Phase (Blue Section)**
   - Players define system components, interfaces, and risk analysis.
   - Spaces for requirement definition, technical analysis, and subsystem integration.
   
3. **Requirements Writing Phase (Yellow Section)**
   - Writing clear, verifiable, and regulatory-compliant requirements.
   - Spaces for drafting user needs, system requirements, and validation plans.
   
4. **Prototyping Phase (Orange Section)**
   - Developing and refining a prototype based on defined requirements.
   - Spaces for prototyping, iteration, and user feedback collection.
   
5. **Verification & Validation Phase (Purple Section)**
   - Players conduct testing, analyze results, and finalize product design.
   - Spaces for test execution, risk mitigation, and final design approval.
   
6. **Regulatory Approval Phase (Red Section)**
   - Players prepare regulatory submissions and address compliance issues.
   - Spaces for documentation submission, regulatory review, and inspection.

## Special Spaces
- **Chance Spaces**: Players draw from the Chance Deck, introducing random industry events.
- **Community Spaces**: Players draw from the Community Deck, representing external collaboration and business opportunities.
- **Fast Track Lane**: A shortcut available only if players meet specific requirements (e.g., FDA Fast Track approval).

## Movement Rules
- Players move by rolling a **six-sided die (D6)**.
- Some paths have decision nodes where players can take alternate routes, introducing strategic choices.
- Landing on **Event Spaces** forces players to draw an **Event Card** and resolve it immediately.

### Example Layout (Conceptual)

Start → Stakeholder Needs → System Architecture → Requirements Writing → Prototyping → Verification & Validation → Regulatory Approval → Market Launch

Players progress along this path, completing challenges in each phase until they reach the final goal: **Market Launch**.
