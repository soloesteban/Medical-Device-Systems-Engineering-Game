GPT for creating the cards:

Create svg image code for all the event cards defined in #file:event_cards.qmd. Put the content of the cards into a rounded rectangle of 85mm (height) by 60mm (width). Create an individual text file for each svg code for each card. Use #file:event card template.txt as the template for the cards. Ensure the text of the card fits into each card, wrap text as necessary. Take note that these are board game cards. Put the files in the folder called "event cards" that exists in the workspace. The card tile text needs to be 3 words or less for each line. The rest of the content should be 4 words or less for each line. Lower the text of the effect to be a little closer to the bottom of the card. Also create the file for the first card. The file names of each card should include the card ID.
