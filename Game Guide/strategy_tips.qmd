# Strategy Tips

To succeed in **Critical Path: The Systems Engineer’s Quest**, players must balance risk, resource management, and strategic decision-making. Here are some essential strategies to help you win the game.

## Prioritize Key Resources
- **Funding Tokens**: Allocate funds wisely to avoid financial setbacks in later phases.
<!-- **Expertise Tokens**: Invest in technical and regulatory expertise early to improve success rates in complex challenges.-->
- **Innovation Tokens**: Use these sparingly but effectively—breakthroughs can accelerate your progress.
- **Morale Points**: Keep morale high; low morale impacts dice rolls and task outcomes.

## Plan Your Path Efficiently
- **Use Alternate Routes**: Some board spaces allow for different paths—take advantage of shorter or less risky routes.
- **Fast Track Lane**: If possible, qualify for the Fast Track to bypass difficult phases.
- **Avoid Delays**: Losing time tokens can prevent you from keeping up with competitors.

## Manage Risk and Adapt to Events
- **Mitigate Negative Event Cards**: Keep extra resources handy to counteract setbacks.
- **Leverage Positive Events**: Certain cards offer bonuses—be ready to maximize their effects.
- **Balance High-Risk Decisions**: Some challenges offer big rewards but come with high failure rates—assess your chances before taking the risk.

## Master Task Resolution
- **Optimize Dice Rolls**: Certain skills improve success rates; investing in expertise early can pay off.
- **Look for Bonus Rewards**: Some tasks provide additional benefits if completed successfully—choose them wisely.
- **Don’t Rush Prototyping**: A well-tested prototype can prevent costly rework later.

## Consider Player Interactions
- **Trade Strategically**: Exchange expertise and resources with competitors when beneficial.
- **Block Opponents**: Delay others by securing patents, outbidding funding, or leveraging event outcomes.
- **Negotiate Alliances**: Temporary alliances can help overcome shared obstacles, but be ready to compete in the final stretch.

## Stay Flexible
- **Monitor Competitor Progress**: Adjust your strategy based on what other players are doing.
- **Adapt to Changing Conditions**: Regulatory updates and market shifts can affect your approach—stay nimble.
- **Don’t Hoard Resources**: Spend wisely, but avoid over-saving—unused resources don’t win games!
