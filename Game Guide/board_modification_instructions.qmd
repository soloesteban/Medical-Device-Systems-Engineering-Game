# Instructions for Modifying a 20” x 20” Board for Critical Path: The Systems Engineer’s Quest

To effectively design a **game board**, you should divide it into **six key development phases**, integrate **paths for movement**, and ensure **clear sections for events and actions**. Below is a **detailed step-by-step guide** to modifying the blank board.

## Define the Game Board Layout
The board should be structured **like a Monopoly-style layout**, with **all spaces on the outer edge** and players moving **clockwise** around the board.

### Board Sections and Spaces (Clockwise Path)
| Position | Phase | Space Type | Description |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1  | Stakeholder Needs  | Start Space  | Players begin their journey. |
| 2  | Stakeholder Needs  | Task Space  | Conduct Stakeholder Interviews. |
| 3  | Stakeholder Needs  | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 4  | Stakeholder Needs  | Task Space  | Meet with Key Opinion Leaders. |
| 5  | Stakeholder Needs  | Collaboration Space  | Players may trade tokens. |
| 6  | Stakeholder Needs  | Task Space  | Perform Market Research. |
| 7  | Stakeholder Needs  | Fast Track Space  | Spend an Innovation Token to advance two spaces. |
| 8  | System Architecture  | Task Space  | Define System Requirements. |
| 9  | System Architecture  | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 10 | System Architecture  | Task Space  | Conduct Risk Analysis. |
| 11 | System Architecture  | Reinvestment Space  | Spend Funding Tokens to improve technology. |
| 12 | System Architecture  | Task Space  | Review Technical Specifications. |
| 13 | System Architecture  | Task Space  | Identify Subsystem Requirements. |
| 14 | Requirements Writing | Task Space  | Draft Initial Requirements. |
| 15 | Requirements Writing | Market Challenge Space | A competitor introduces a rival product. |
| 16 | Requirements Writing | Task Space  | Conduct Stakeholder Review. |
| 17 | Requirements Writing | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 18 | Requirements Writing | Task Space  | Ensure Regulatory Compliance. |
| 19 | Prototyping  | Task Space  | Develop First Prototype. |
| 20 | Prototyping  | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 21 | Prototyping  | Task Space  | Test Prototype for Usability. |
| 22 | Prototyping  | Collaboration Space  | Players can trade resources. |
| 23 | Prototyping  | Task Space  | Conduct Design Iteration. |
| 24 | Prototyping  | Fast Track Space  | Spend an Innovation Token to advance. |
| 25 | Verification & Validation  | Task Space  | Execute Test Plan. |
| 26 | Verification & Validation  | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 27 | Verification & Validation  | Task Space  | Conduct Risk Management Review. |
| 28 | Verification & Validation  | Task Space  | Perform Biocompatibility Testing. |
| 29 | Verification & Validation  | Market Challenge Space  | A new regulation changes testing requirements. |
| 30 | Regulatory Approval  | Task Space  | Submit Regulatory Documentation. |
| 31 | Regulatory Approval  | Event Space  | Draw an Event Card. |
| 32 | Regulatory Approval  | Task Space  | Respond to Regulatory Questions. |
| 33 | Regulatory Approval  | Audit Space  | Players must pass a compliance check. |
| 34 | Regulatory Approval  | Final Task Space  | Obtain Market Approval. |
| 35 | Market Launch  | Victory Space  | Players complete their product launch! |

## Preparing the Board Surface
### Materials Needed
- Permanent markers or **vinyl stickers** for labeling.
- **Painter’s tape** for layout adjustments.
- **Acrylic paint or printable decals** for coloring sections.
- **Clear sealant spray (optional)** for durability.

### Step-by-Step Board Modification
1. **Mark the Outer Border** – Use a **ruler and marker** to **outline 35 spaces** along the board’s edges.
2. **Divide the Board into Sections**:
   - Assign each space based on the list above.
   - Use **painter’s tape** to ensure correct alignment before finalizing.
3. **Add Visual Elements**:
   - **Arrows and direction markers** to show clockwise movement.
   - **Icons and colors** to differentiate each phase.

## Special Spaces and Gameplay Enhancements
### Fast Track Spaces:
- Players who land here can **spend an Innovation Token** to **skip ahead** by two spaces.

### Collaboration Spaces:
- Players may **trade tokens and strategies** when landing here.

### Market Challenge Spaces:
- A competitor event occurs, requiring **a dice roll to determine impact**.

### Regulatory Audit Space:
- Players must **roll a die** to pass compliance. Failure results in losing a turn.

## Coloring and Design Enhancements
- **Green** → Stakeholder Needs
- **Blue** → System Architecture
- **Yellow** → Requirements Writing
- **Orange** → Prototyping
- **Purple** → Verification & Validation
- **Red** → Regulatory Approval
- **Gold** → Market Launch (Final Victory Space)

Use **paint, colored markers, or printed decals** to define these zones clearly.

## Final Touches
- Test the board with prototype gameplay before finalizing.
- Ensure all spaces are readable and visually distinct.
- Laminate the board for added durability.
