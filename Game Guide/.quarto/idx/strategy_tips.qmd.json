Here are some essential strategies to help you win the game.\n\n## Prioritize Key Resources\n- **Funding Tokens**: Allocate funds wisely to avoid financial setbacks in later phases.\n<!-- **Expertise Tokens**: Invest in technical and regulatory expertise early to improve success rates in complex challenges.-->\n- **Innovation Tokens**: Use these sparingly but effectively—breakthroughs can accelerate your progress.\n- **Morale Points**: Keep morale high; low morale impacts dice rolls and task outcomes.\n\n## Plan Your Path Efficiently\n- **Use Alternate Routes**: Some board spaces allow for different paths—take advantage of shorter or less risky routes.\n- **Fast Track Lane**: If possible, qualify for the Fast Track to bypass difficult phases.\n- **Avoid Delays**: Losing time tokens can prevent you from keeping up with competitors.\n\n## Manage Risk and Adapt to Events\n- **Mitigate Negative Event Cards**: Keep extra resources handy to counteract setbacks.\n- **Leverage Positive Events**: Certain cards offer bonuses—be ready to maximize their effects.\n- **Balance High-Risk Decisions**: Some challenges offer big rewards but come with high failure rates—assess your chances before taking the risk.\n\n## Master Task Resolution\n- **Optimize Dice Rolls**: Certain skills improve success rates; investing in expertise early can pay off.\n- **Look for Bonus Rewards**: Some tasks provide additional benefits if completed successfully—choose them wisely.\n- **Don’t Rush Prototyping**: A well-tested prototype can prevent costly rework later.\n\n## Consider Player Interactions\n- **Trade Strategically**: Exchange expertise and resources with competitors when beneficial.\n- **Block Opponents**: Delay others by securing patents, outbidding funding, or leveraging event outcomes.\n- **Negotiate Alliances**: Temporary alliances can help overcome shared obstacles, but be ready to compete in the final stretch.\n\n## Stay Flexible\n- **Monitor Competitor Progress**: Adjust your strategy based on what other players are doing.\n- **Adapt to Changing Conditions**: Regulatory updates and market shifts can affect your approach—stay nimble.\n- **Don’t Hoard
