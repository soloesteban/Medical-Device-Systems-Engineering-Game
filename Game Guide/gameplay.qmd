# Gameplay Mechanics

## Turn Structure
Each turn consists of the following steps:

1. **Roll Dice & Move**
   - Roll a six-sided die and move the corresponding number of spaces along the board.
   - If you land on a **Task Space**, draw a **Task Card** and resolve it.
   - If you land on an **Event Space**, draw an **Event Card** and follow its instructions.
   
2. **Resolve Task Cards**
   - Each Task Card presents a challenge within the current game phase (e.g., "Conduct stakeholder interviews").
   - Roll the required dice (based on skills/resources) to determine success or failure.
   - Success advances the player’s project; failure may result in setbacks or lost resources.

3. **Manage Resources**
   - Players may spend **Funding Tokens** to buy additional dice rolls, upgrades, or event mitigations.
   - Morale fluctuates based on game events—low morale limits progress.

4. **End Turn**
   - After resolving a Task or Event, the turn passes clockwise.

## Game Phases
Each player must progress through the following six phases to complete their medical device:

1. **Stakeholder Needs Phase**
   - Identify and balance patient, physician, and regulatory requirements.
   - Make trade-offs between clinical needs and manufacturability.
   
2. **System Architecture Phase**
   - Define technical specifications and functional block diagrams.
   - Ensure integration of electrical, mechanical, and software components.
   
3. **Requirements Writing Phase**
   - Translate stakeholder input into clear, testable requirements.
   - Align with industry standards (ISO 13485, IEC 60601, etc.).
   
4. **Prototyping Phase**
   - Build and refine initial device prototypes.
   - Conduct design verification tests to identify flaws.
   
5. **Verification & Validation Phase**
   - Execute preclinical testing, bench testing, and human factors studies.
   - Meet all safety and regulatory standards before submission.
   
6. **Regulatory Approval Phase**
   - Submit documentation to regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA, etc.).
   - Address regulatory questions, conduct audits, and finalize

## Advancing to the Next Phase

Once the required Task Cards for the current phase are successfully resolved, players may advance to the next phase. Follow these steps:

1. **Declare Phase Completion**:
   - Announce that you have completed all tasks for the current phase.
   - Ensure all required resources and conditions are met.

2. **Reset Phase-Specific Resources** (if applicable):
   - Discard any unused Task Cards from the current phase.
   - Draw new Task Cards for the next phase.

3. **Start the Next Phase**:
   - Begin the next phase on your next turn.
   - Follow the rules and challenges specific to the new phase.

4. **Special Rules for Transition**:
   - If an Event Card or game mechanic affects phase transitions, resolve it before starting the next phase.

## Winning the Game
The first player to **complete all six phases and gain regulatory approval** successfully launches their device and wins the game!
